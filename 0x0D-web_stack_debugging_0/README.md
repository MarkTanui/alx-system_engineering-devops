# Web stack debugging #0

## Background Context

Computers and software rarely work the way we want, being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master of it.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, you should figure out what is going on and fix it manually.

### Tasks

**0. Give me a page!**

For this project you will be given a container which you can use to solve the task.
Be sure to read the Docker concept page.

In this first debugging project, you will need to get Apache to run on the container and to return a page containing Hello Holberton when querying the root of it.
